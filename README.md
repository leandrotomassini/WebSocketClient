# WebSocketClient

A robust and efficient client for handling WebSocket communications.

## Overview

This project provides a client-side implementation for establishing and managing a connection to a WebSocket server. It's designed to be straightforward to use while offering powerful features for real-time data exchange.

## Features

*   **Easy Connection Management:** Simple API to connect, disconnect, and auto-reconnect.
*   **Message Handling:** Send and receive messages asynchronously.
*   **Event-Driven:** Responds to open, close, error, and message events.
*   **Secure Connections:** Supports `wss://` for secure WebSocket connections.

## Installation

To use this client, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

*(Further installation steps would go here, e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, etc.)*

## Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use the WebSocket client:

```javascript
// Example usage (assuming a JavaScript implementation)

const client = new WebSocketClient('wss://your-websocket-server.com');

client.on('open', () => {
  console.log('Connection established!');
  client.send('Hello, Server!');
});

client.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('Received:', message);
});

client.on('close', () => {
  console.log('Connection closed.');
});

client.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket Error:', error);
});

client.connect();
```
